Overview:
	Dino Island has valuable resource (mana?) that keeps the dinos alive
	and the island lush and green. Moneybags discovers the island and
	intends to use his robotic army to seize Dino Island by force to mine
	the resource as an energy source.

	Players realize their goal to stop Moneybags won't be possible without
	outside help, so go out of their way to summon the ultimate dino, a
	fabled dragon thought to lay dormant in the lava of the island's
	volcano. Unfortunately, it turns out that this is just a legend, as
	nothing happens when the player completes the ritual.
Final boss fight:
	Some giant mech taken down with normal gameplay elements. After 2-3
	phases, Moneybags seems taken down. However, he claims that he's tired
	of fighting for what he wants but won't accept defeat. He calls upon
	his Halberd-esque ship to wrench the island out of the ocean and drop
	it, destroying the island and its inhabitants. He almost succeeds, and
	as the island is falling down, player characters say their goodbyes.
	Camera cuts back to ocean, then descends to the seafloor, where a
	volcanic ocean ridge begins to rumble. An eye opens, revealing the
	ridge to be the back of the dragon of lore. It launches itself from 
	the seafloor, breaching the surface and commanding the waves to carry
	it up to the island, catching it mid-descent and lowering it carefully
	into the water. Final phase of boss fight is players commanding the 
	dragon in a battle against Moneybags's Halberd-esque ship.

	Probably include a Death-Star-esque explosion and ending
